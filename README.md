# Packet Sniffer Tool (Python)

A simple and effective network packet sniffer built using Python and Scapy. This tool captures and analyzes live network traffic, displaying important information such as:

- Source & Destination IP addresses
- Protocols (TCP/UDP)
- Port Numbers
- Payload (limited to 100 characters)

> **Note:** This tool is strictly for **educational and ethical** purposes only.

---

## Features

- Real-time packet capture
- Protocol and port identification
- Lightweight and console-based
- Timestamped logs for each packet
- Easy to understand for beginners in cybersecurity

---

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

### Install Scapy

```bash
pip install scapy


---

Usage

python packet_sniffer.py

You can optionally specify a network interface:
